    <h1>Why sifting changes flour weight</h1>
    <p>Sifting flour adds air and breaks up clumps. That sounds harmless, but it changes how flour settles in a measuring cup. A sifted cup can weigh significantly less than an unsifted cup.</p>
    <p>Most flour has been compacted in the bag. If you scoop directly from the bag, you pull in extra flour because the cup compresses it further. If you sift first, you fluff the flour and reduce the amount that fits into the same cup.</p>
    <p>This is why recipes often specify “1 cup sifted flour” or “1 cup flour, sifted.” The difference is when the sifting happens. “1 cup sifted flour” means sift, then measure. “1 cup flour, sifted” means measure first, then sift for texture.</p>
    <p>When converting between cups and grams, weight is more dependable than volume. A cup of all‑purpose flour can range from roughly 110–140 g depending on technique. That range can make or break a cake.</p>
    <p>Use a kitchen scale if you can. If you must measure by volume, use the spoon‑and‑level method: lightly spoon flour into the cup and level it off without tapping. That approximates an average density and is closer to the standard conversions.</p>
    <p>On Numericano, the <a href="/cooking/all-purpose-flour/cup-to-g/">all‑purpose flour</a> conversion page uses a standard kitchen density. If you’re sifting before measuring, expect your flour to be slightly lighter per cup.</p>
    <p>For cake flour and pastry flour, sifting matters even more. These flours are finely milled and trap more air. The best practice is always to weigh them instead of relying on a cup measure.</p>
    <p>In short: sifting changes volume, which changes weight in a cup. If precision matters, use grams. If a recipe depends on texture, follow its sifting instructions exactly.</p>
