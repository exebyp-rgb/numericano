    <h1>Butter: solid vs melted weight</h1>
    <p>Butter is one of the clearest examples of why density matters. A cup of solid butter does not weigh the same as a cup of melted butter. The reason is simple: solid butter contains air gaps, while melted butter does not. When butter melts, it settles into a denser volume, which increases grams per cup.</p>
    <p>If a recipe specifies “melted butter,” it expects the heavier, denser version. Measuring solid butter and then melting it can leave you short. Conversely, if a recipe expects solid butter and you pour melted butter into the measuring cup, you may add too much fat and moisture.</p>
    <p>Look at the conversions: <a href="/cooking/butter/cup-to-g/">solid butter cup to grams</a> and <a href="/cooking/butter-melted/cup-to-g/">melted butter cup to grams</a>. The difference is significant, especially when a recipe uses multiple cups. Even for a half cup, the difference can affect texture in cookies and cakes.</p>
    <p>Why does this matter in practice? Butter contributes fat, moisture, and structure. In cookies, extra melted butter can increase spread and chewiness. In cakes, it can lead to a heavier crumb. In pastry, the state of butter affects lamination and flakiness. A precise measure keeps the recipe’s balance intact.</p>
    <p>If you’re using a scale, the solution is easy: weigh the butter in the state called for. If the recipe wants melted butter, melt it and weigh the liquid. If it wants solid butter, weigh the solid sticks or cubes before melting. This eliminates the air-gap issue entirely.</p>
    <p>When you must use cups, pay attention to the measurement order. For solid butter, cut into pieces and lightly fill the measuring cup without pressing. For melted butter, pour into a liquid measuring cup at eye level. Avoid using a dry cup for melted butter; it is easy to overfill.</p>
    <p>Temperature matters too. Butter softens before it melts, and softened butter still contains air pockets. That means “softened” is not the same as “melted.” If the recipe specifically calls for softened butter, use the solid butter conversion as a closer match.</p>
    <p>Butter alternatives like margarine or plant-based butter can have slightly different water content. If you substitute, use weight to stay consistent. Density data helps, but ingredient composition can still change the outcome.</p>
    <p>Numericano treats solid butter and melted butter as separate entries because they behave differently. Use the specific conversion page that matches your recipe. It takes a few seconds and saves a lot of troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>Whenever a recipe feels off, check butter measurement first. It is one of the highest-impact ingredients by weight, and the solid vs melted distinction is an easy place for hidden errors.</p>

        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">Yes, browning evaporates water, reducing weight. Weigh browned butter after cooking if the recipe is sensitive.</p>
