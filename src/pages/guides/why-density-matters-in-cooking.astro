    <h1>Why density matters in cooking</h1>
    <p>Volume is convenient, but weight is consistent. Density is the missing link that explains why a cup of flour does not weigh the same as a cup of sugar, and why a cup of honey is heavier than a cup of water. Understanding density makes your conversions reliable and your recipes repeatable.</p>
    <p>Density is simply weight per volume, usually expressed in grams per milliliter. If you know the density of an ingredient, you can convert from cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons into grams. That conversion is what turns “1 cup” into a number you can compare across ingredients and across brands.</p>
    <p>Consider two common baking staples: flour and granulated sugar. Flour is airy and traps a lot of air between particles, so it weighs less per cup. Granulated sugar is heavier because the crystals settle tightly. That’s why <a href="/cooking/all-purpose-flour/cup-to-g/">a cup of all‑purpose flour</a> weighs far less than <a href="/cooking/granulated-sugar/cup-to-g/">a cup of granulated sugar</a>. The density tells you exactly how far apart they are.</p>
    <p>Density also explains why the same ingredient can have different conversions. Brown sugar is heavier when packed, lighter when loose, and light or dark brown sugar is heavier still because of additional molasses. The ingredient is the same, but the density changes with packing and moisture.</p>
    <p>Liquids feel simple, yet they have densities too. Water is close to 1.0 g/mL, which is why many cooks remember that 1 cup of water is about 236 g. But oils are lighter, while syrups are heavier. Olive oil sits around 0.91 g/mL, and honey is closer to 1.42 g/mL. Using water’s density for everything will skew your conversions.</p>
    <p>Temperature matters. Butter is a classic example: a cup of solid butter weighs less than a cup of melted butter because the melted form fills the air gaps. Coconut oil behaves similarly, changing density as it moves from solid to liquid. If your recipe specifies melted or solid, that is a density clue.</p>
    <p>Density matters for seasoning too. A tablespoon of table salt can be almost twice the weight of a tablespoon of kosher salt because the crystals are different sizes. That’s a density difference, not a taste difference. When you see large variations in saltiness, the measuring style and crystal type are usually the reason.</p>
    <p>When you build a measurement system around density, you gain consistency. You can scale recipes accurately, swap ingredients confidently, and troubleshoot recipes that are too dry or too wet. If you bake often, you’ll start to recognize that small density differences compound over multiple cups.</p>
    <p>Numericano aims to make density practical. You don’t need to memorize every number. Use the ingredient pages and conversion tables for quick, realistic values, then adjust with experience. Over time you’ll find your preferred brands and methods.</p>
    <p>Density is not a theoretical detail; it’s the reason your cookies spread or your cakes rise. If a recipe is not behaving, look at the conversions and ask whether the ingredient density you assumed matches how you measured. That single check often solves the mystery.</p>
