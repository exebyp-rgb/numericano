    <h1>Common cooking measurement mistakes</h1>
    <p>Most cooking issues come from a few repeated measurement habits. Fixing them makes recipes more consistent and easier to scale.</p>
    <p><strong>1) Scooping flour from the bag.</strong> This packs extra flour into the cup. Use spoon‑and‑level or weigh flour instead. The <a href="/cooking/all-purpose-flour/cup-to-g/">all‑purpose flour</a> conversion page uses a standard density that assumes spoon‑and‑level.</p>
    <p><strong>2) Not leveling measuring cups.</strong> A heaping cup can add 10–20% more of an ingredient. Always level dry ingredients with a flat edge, and read liquid measures at eye level.</p>
    <p><strong>3) Using liquid cups for dry measures.</strong> Liquid measuring cups are designed for accuracy at a fill line. Dry cups are meant to be filled and leveled. This swap alone can shift results.</p>
    <p><strong>4) Ignoring ingredient density.</strong> A cup of sugar and a cup of flour do not weigh the same. If you swap by volume, adjust by weight using the correct conversion page, such as <a href="/cooking/granulated-sugar/cup-to-g/">granulated sugar</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>5) Measuring sticky ingredients without prep.</strong> Honey, molasses, and syrups cling to cups. Grease the cup or weigh them for better accuracy.</p>
    <p><strong>6) Forgetting to tare the scale.</strong> If you weigh ingredients in a bowl, always zero the scale between additions. This keeps each ingredient accurate and prevents compounding errors.</p>
    <p><strong>7) Confusing teaspoon and tablespoon.</strong> A tablespoon is three times a teaspoon. Double‑check abbreviations: tsp and Tbsp are not interchangeable.</p>
    <p><strong>8) Mixing metric and US units without conversion.</strong> A US cup is 236.6 mL, not 250 mL. Use the <a href="/cooking/water/cup-to-ml/">cup to milliliters</a> conversion when a recipe mixes systems.</p>
    <p><strong>9) Measuring by packed vs loose without noting it.</strong> Brown sugar and coconut sugar can be packed or loose, which changes weight per cup. Always follow the recipe’s instruction.</p>
    <p><strong>10) Scaling recipes by volume only.</strong> If you double a recipe by volume, small errors become large. Weighing ingredients gives you repeatable results at any scale.</p>
    <p>When in doubt, weigh. A scale is the most consistent tool in the kitchen. Use Numericano’s conversions to bridge between cups, grams, ounces, and milliliters when you need volume equivalents.</p>
